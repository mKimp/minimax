# Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning

There are 2 files, one is 3x3 and one is 4x4 board size of playing Tic Tac Toe. In the main file, there is a block comment to explain how to run either Minimax alone or Alpha-Beta Pruning on the board.
The comments are more specific in the file for board 3x3, explaining which part doing what. The functions used are similar, and the only different is condition to win the game changing from 3 same marks to 4 marks horizontally or vertically on the board. 

For your information, if you pick Minimax on 4x4, the running time for a move could last more than 40 minutes due to the large game tree.
